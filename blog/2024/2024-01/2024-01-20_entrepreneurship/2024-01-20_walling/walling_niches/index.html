The competition is also a lot lower</li><li>What matters is finding a group of people who need your something more than they need the money you’re charging for it</li><li>Provide your product with no hassles at a price where you make a healthy profit and you’re set</li><li>If you choose a niche market and focus so tightly that your product becomes the best in class, members of that niche will have no choice but to use your product</li><li>Here’s an exercise: Pick one person you know well&mldr;your spouse, your brother, your sister, a parent, etc<ul><li>How hard would it be to design a product that you’re sure this person would use… not very hard, right?</li><li>That’s because you know so much about the intimate details of their life</li><li>Based on your knowledge of their interest in playing death metal on the banjo, for example, you might build a website that aggregates every death metal banjo tablature on the web</li><li>Since your product would be so laser focused to their interests, it wouldn’t already exist</li></ul></li><li>The larger a market, the more money you’ll need to spend in order to locate people willing to buy your product</li><li>Instead of marketing to everyone who likes to travel, how about tailoring your product to people who like to travel to the American Northwest?</li><li>If a publisher started a magazine aimed at a niche, and full-page ads are less than $5,000, it’s a good niche to explore</li><li>If you provide something so uniquely targeted towards them you can focus the ad itself, your copy, and your product on what they need, they are more likely to visit your website</li><li>Owning the majority of a $500,000/year market is enough to support a very profitable startup</li><li>Less competition means you are able to charge more for your product, resulting in higher margins</li><li>Niche Markets Are Not Used to Good Marketing</li><li>If you take out an ad on websites they visit, advertise on AdWords for similar keywords, and have a Facebook group, in a small niche it’s likely they’ll run into you more than once over a short period of time<ul><li>Given the number of marketing messages we hear every day, hearing about anything more than once has become remarkable</li></ul></li><li>Building an invoicing solution that satisfies every single pain point for pool cleaners is not that difficult.
