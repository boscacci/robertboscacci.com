I'm an AWS-[certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/7afe970a-4997-459d-92ab-ae0e86ae48c6/public_url) Data Engineer and [author](/book)  ðŸ“– who used to work in [film](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/)ðŸŽ¬

[_The Spring of Sight_](/book) is my debut nonfiction book from 2022. It's about computer vision and its big implications for society. I wrote it with my boomer real-estate-agent mother in mind, so it should be highly readable even if you've never written a line of code! Grab a copy for only [99Â¢ on the kindle store](https://www.amazon.com/Spring-Sight-Inflection-Computer-Society-ebook/dp/B0C5NBXFRJ).

My [professional history is on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rboscacci/). I've been coding for money since early 2019 in roles like "Data Scientist" or "Senior Data Mining Engineer." Someday, I hope to work in a role that can use both:
* My 10+ years of domain knowledge in video (post-production), and also...
* My 6+ years exp. in automation, __computer vision__, and cloud computing

I live with my super cool genomic-science-lady fiance [Catherine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-mayo-ms-cgc-126153111/) in Brooklyn, NY, but not for long; we're moving to Seattle in July 2025, after our wedding.
