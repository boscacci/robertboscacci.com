I'm a data engineer and [author](/book) who used to work in [film](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/)!

I currently work with [SilverRide, Inc](https://silverride.com/), a company providing older folks with another paratransit option — and I’m all over **Azure + AWS** these days.

I did a data science bootcamp in 2018 and the rest is history. It’s 2026 now; we’re entering the era of Claude Code.

[_The Spring of Sight_](/book) (2022) is my debut nonfiction book. It's about the ongoing renaissance in __Computer Vision__ and its big implications for society.

Here's a little digital badge that proves I'm good at AWS things:
