### Interests & Ideal Roles

I'm equally enthusiastic about two main directions for my next role—and they're not mutually exclusive:

- **Media Analytics:** I'm particularly excited about opportunities to:
  - Help companies understand audience behavior
  - Optimize content performance

**and/or**

  - Leveraging analytics to improve sustainability
  - Designing systems that enhance urban accessibility
  - Building tools to support overworked healthcare professionals
  - Contributing to solutions for immigration challenges
