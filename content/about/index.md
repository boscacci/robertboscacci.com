I'm an AWS-[certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/7afe970a-4997-459d-92ab-ae0e86ae48c6/public_url) Data Engineer and [author](/book) ðŸ“– who used to work in [film](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/)ðŸŽ¬!

[_The Spring of Sight_](/book) (2022) is my debut nonfiction book. It's about the ongoing renaissance in __Computer Vision__ and its big implications for society.

My [career history is on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rboscacci/). In a nutshell, I am a pro with Python, shell scripting, and AWS. I've been coding for money since 2019 in roles like "Data Science Lead" at [Butter Works](https://butter.works) or "Sr. Data Mining Engineer" at [Angi](https://www.angi.com/aboutus.htm). I am a fan of Docker, serverless stuff, and infrastructure-as-code. I've _really_ enjoyed fine-tuning [vision models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cinemarob1/Film-slate-or-nah).

I'm hoping to find work with an org that is at least morally neutral (i.e. no Amazon/Google/Meta/Walmart/Lockheed/Monsanto) and can use both:
* My 10+ years deep domain knowledge in __video__ (production + post)
* My 6+ years exp. in automation, __computer vision__, and cloud computing.

For example, I would LOVE to help improve patient outcomes and ease the burden on overworked healthcare workers! I believe this is one of the best use-cases for computer vision. Otherwise, I could see myself at really any company that wants to do [innovative new things with computer vision](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/neural-networks-model-audience-reactions-movies-79098). Perhaps in film.

I live with my rad genomic-science-lady [fiance](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-mayo-ms-cgc-126153111/) in Brooklyn, NY, but not for long; we're moving to Seattle in July 2025. I love cycling, backpacking, cold-brewing 3 liters of specialty coffee at a time, and my two cats.

## Mind Map

Here's a [little map](https://www.plectica.com/maps/9XZY87ZGW) of my brain, including **skills**, **interests**, and **values**.

## Trivia

* [The New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/realestate/a-couch-surfer-lands-his-perfect-apartment.html) on my move from SFBay to NYC

* I eat a flaming muffin in [a semi-popular music video from 2011](https://youtu.be/5dE-7-kBxXw?t=135)

* I [walked clear across](https://magazine.scu.edu/magazines/spring-2013/walk-across-california/) the state of California as part of a university class

## Cinema Career

I [am credited](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574526/) as a colorist or dailies technician on major movies and TV shows featuring Pedro Pascal, Spike Lee, Paul Giamatti, Errol Morris, and more. My 10+ year career in film brought me to BogotÃ¡, Myanmar, Alaska, Alcatraz, Hawaii, the U.S.-Mexico border, and beyond. Someday I'd love to bring my new skill-set back to the industry that taught me what it means to be a professional.
