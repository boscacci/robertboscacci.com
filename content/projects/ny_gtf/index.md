## What:

I was hired as a contractor to take [this broken WordPress site](https://web.archive.org/web/20220311091755/https://nysgeneticstaskforce.org/):
<a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20220311091755/https://nysgeneticstaskforce.org/' target='_blank' style="display:block;">

</a>

And improve it, porting it over to Squarespace for easy management:

## Why:

My fiance's friend was the president of the New York State Genetics Task force. In the absence of their previous webmistress, the org was struggling to maintain their old WordPress site---which involved user registrations, membership payments, calendar events, a blog, and more. Their hosting provider was over-charging for SSL certs, hosting, domain names, and other weird random add-ons. I knew I could help.

## How

With input from the Task Force board, I put together a new web design on Squarespace. You can administer paid subscriptions and paywalled members-only pages natively there, for a reasonable monthly price. I liaised with the previous webmistress to gain access to hosting credentials, and successfully transitioned the domain names from HostMonster (?) to Squarespace.

If the client plans to manage the site on their own after the initial setup, there's no sense in building it from scratch with React or some other fancy web framework. Squarespace is great for this sort of arrangement.
