## Why

Back in ~2016-2018 I used to spend many, many hours in a dark room in SoHo scrubbing through video files to see where the slate claps were, so that I could fix the audio sync. It got very boring, to the point where I quit to go learn how to code.

## What

Why not have AI automate the boring stuff? Given enough labeled examples, a pre-trained image model should be able to spot slates, after some fine-tuning. I achieved a COCOmetric of like 88% with a few hundred images. It's just a fine-tuned faster-rcnn model.

The natural next step would be to train it on two classes: "Open" and "closed" slates, so that you could find the inflection point where the slate goes from open to closed. That might save some dailies technicians a lot of time.

## Tools

My data science mentor pointed me to [IceVision](https://github.com/airctic/icevision), [FastAI](https://course.fast.ai/), and various [TIMM models](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/timm). I got set up with [LabelStudio](https://labelstud.io/) and [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). I wrote a [long LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rboscacci_icevision-activity-6993242508814090240-aFeq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) about how I accomplished the fine-tuning.

In case you didn't already know, it can be incredibly frustrating to do data-intensive machine learning stuff on an Apple Silicone laptop. Rather than swapping out my local hardware, I took this opportunity to get really dirty with Ec2 spot instances and used Terraform to make it dead simple to spin up and tear down spot GPU instances.
