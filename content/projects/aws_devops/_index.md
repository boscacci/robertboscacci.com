This is my study material for the [AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/) exam, version DOP-C02. 

I just registered to take the exam in a little more than a month, so I'd better get started studying! I started taking notes in OneNote at first, but I quickly realized they'll be more organized and thorough if I just post them here. I hope you find them helpful!
