__"Software Development Lifecycle"__

## What does CI/CD Solve?

* Awkward waterfall-style project flow:
	* Slow
	* Not iterative
	* Long release cycles

## How do we merge dev and ops goals?

* Dev and Ops are not traditionally aligned
	* Dev wants changes, features, _more_
	* Ops wants stable/available systems

* Deliver features, fixes, and updates frequently - but automate QA!

## What are Continuous Delivery vs. C. Deployment?

__Delivery:__ Automate everything up until before deployment; deploy manually

__Deployment:__ Confidently deploy to prod automatically after it passes QA.

## What are the AWS Dev Tools?

* Code commit: Like GitHub
* CodeBuild: Self-explanatory
* CodeDeploy: Self-explanatory
