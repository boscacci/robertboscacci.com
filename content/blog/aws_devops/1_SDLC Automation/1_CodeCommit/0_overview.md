## What is it?

* A managed service to host _private_ git repos.
* It's highly available, scalable, fault-tolerant
* Commands will be familiar if you use git normally

## Why not just use git?

* No concerns about managing version control servers
* It plays nice with other AWS services 
	* E.g. build, pipeline, deploy, lambda, SNS

## What other repos can I use in AWS deployments?
* S3
* GitHub (+ enterprise)
* Bitbucket
