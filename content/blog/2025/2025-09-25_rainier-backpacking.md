We're heading out for an easy 3-day backpacking trip in Mount Rainier National Park, and I wanted to share our plan, route, and a few tips in case you're considering something similar.
{{< /lead >}}

## Trip Overview

We’ll be spending two nights in the backcountry (September 26-28, 2025), starting at the Dry Creek Trailhead. Our first night is at Lake George Camp, the second at South Puyallup River Camp, and then we’ll hike out on Sunday. If you’re interested in planning a similar trip, here’s how we’re approaching it.

## Permits & Passes

We reserved our [wilderness permit](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/4675309) in advance through recreation.gov (wilderness.gov redirects there). If you expect to pick up your permit after 12pm, be sure to let the rangers know you’ll need a “late pickup”—otherwise, they may not hold your permit past noon.

You’ll also need a park entrance pass. We use the very reasonably priced [America the Beautiful Pass](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm), which covers entry to all national parks for a year.

After a certain point in the season, they remove the "bear poles" that people can use to safely store food (up high) at campsites. Since they're coming down today, we'll be bringing our own bear-safe food canister for smellables. They also lend out complimentary bear canisters at the wilderness info centers, where you pick up your permits before setting out.

## Our Itinerary

### Friday, September 26th
- Take a half day at work; leave Seattle after lunch
- Pick up permits at Longmire Wilderness Info Center (let them know if you’ll arrive after 12pm)
- Park at Dry Creek Trailhead and start hiking
- Hike about 4.5 miles to Lake George Camp (aiming to arrive before dark)

### Saturday, September 27th  
- Hike about 3 (steep) miles to South Puyallup River Camp
- Set up camp, then day-hike or explore nearby
- Relax and chill; let the mountain seep into our subconscious

### Sunday, September 28th
- Hike back to the car
- Grab a burger at the In n' Out Burger [imitation restaurant](https://www.instagram.com/outandaboutburgers/?hl=en) in Puyallup on the way home
- Go home and coodle our cats 🐱

## Packing & Planning

I keep re-using and evolving this packing list that covers shared gear (tent, stove, bear canister), personal items, and a few fun extras. Feel free to use it as a reference:

## Safety & Communication

We’ve shared our itinerary with family and have a plan in place:
- If we’re not back by Sunday night, a family member will alert the rangers at Longmire
- Permits are secured and our route is approved by the ranger station
- We’re bringing a bear canister and following food storage guidelines
- Emergency contacts are set

## Looking Forward

We’re excited to get out of the city, challenge ourselves to the small climb (with pack weight), and enjoy some quiet nights in the backcountry. And, of course, we’re looking forward to that post-hike burger and seeing our cats again.
