We freeze mid-conversation. It\u0026rsquo;s harvesting berries, completely unfazed by our presence.\nThis moment—unexpected, wild, perfectly ordinary—captures everything I love about Olympic National Park.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how Catherine and I spent three days in the Seven Lakes Basin, and why places like this matter more than ever.\nTrip Overview Permits \u0026amp; Passes We reserve our wilderness permit in advance through recreation.gov. (Olympic NP requires permits for all overnight backcountry trips.) Olympic NP is different from Rainier in that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to pick up your wilderness permits in-person; you can simply print at home, throw it in a ziploc, and carry it along.\nYou also need a park entrance pass. We use the America the Beautiful Pass, which covers entry to all national parks for a year.\nBear canisters are required for food storage in Olympic National Park. You can borrow one for free at the Wilderness Information Center or bring your own. We bring a \u0026ldquo;bear vault\u0026rdquo; model suitable for two people and two nights.\nPacking \u0026amp; Planning We use the same packing list as last weekend, covering shared gear (tent, stove, bear canister), personal items, and a few fun extras. Feel free to use it as a reference:\n📋 View Packing List Route Map Here’s our planned route on Gaia GPS:\n🗺️ View Route on Gaia GPS Our Itinerary Friday, October 3rd We leave Seattle late morning, catch the ferry, and drive to Sol Duc trailhead We hike less than 2 miles to Canyon Creek campsite (#1) We set up camp and relax Saturday, October 4th We hike about 6 miles to Lunch Lake We set up camp at Lunch Lake We explore the area, enjoy the scenery, and chill Sunday, October 5th We hike back down to the car at Sol Duc trailhead We head home—stop for a fun road meal We go home and coodle our cats 🐱 Safety \u0026amp; Communication We share our itinerary with family and have a plan in place:\nIf we don’t return by Sunday night, a family member scrambles the jets Permits are secured We bring a bear canister and follow food storage guidelines Emergency contacts are set Deets \u0026amp; Pics The plan is to spend two nights (October 3–5, 2025) in the \u0026ldquo;Seven Lakes Basin\u0026rdquo; backcountry, starting at the Sol Duc trailhead. The Prius takes a scenic ferry ride with us from Seattle to Bainbridge Island en route to Olympic National Park (which happens to be unstaffed due to the federal government shutdown). This is a good moment for Catherine to wrap up the workweek over some nautical hot cocoa:\nOur first night is at Canyon Creek campsite, less than two miles from the trailhead. We pass Sol Duc Falls and gobs of exotic/enormous mushrooms along the way:\nCamp is damp and sprinkly Friday night—the infamous Pacific Northwest \u0026ldquo;spit\u0026rdquo; that seeps into everything. We\u0026rsquo;re grateful for campsite #1, as #2 sits much higher up the hill. Canyon Creek itself sounds like the inside of my meditation app: that perfect white noise of water over rocks, the kind that makes your shoulders drop and your mind go quiet.\nI put up the door flap on the Big Agnes tent with the aid of some trekking poles and guyline to give us a little semi-outdoor vestibule:\nFriday night, Catherine enjoys her new sleeping quilt; it\u0026rsquo;s less restrictive and just as warm as her Western Mountaineering sleeping bag.\nWe fall asleep to Canyon Creek\u0026rsquo;s lullaby.\nWe wake up to this guy crawling up the side of the tent:\nBanana slugs remind me of the Santa Cruz Mountains and Big Basin, where my family brought me to car-camp in little tent cabins as a kid.\nSaturday is our \u0026ldquo;athletic\u0026rdquo; day—6+ miles of mostly uphill to Lunch Lake. The park begins revealing its true splendor as we climb above the \u0026ldquo;ok-to-have-a-campfire\u0026rdquo; altitude line. The air gets crisper, the views more expansive.\nIt is of course impossible not to miss our cats and unwillingly superimpose the image of their furry faces over every scenic vista. But they\u0026rsquo;ve got their robotic feeder / water fountain / fresh litter box for company.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like those Santa Cruz Mountains from back home, but on steroids. Same Pacific Coast, just\u0026hellip;much closer to Canada.\nA buck nonchalantly greets us on the banks of Lunch Lake:\nSaturday dinner at dusk transforms Lunch Lake into something magical. We rehydrate powdered mashed potatoes and mix in dried pulled pork—chef\u0026rsquo;s kiss. The lake mirrors the sky perfectly, glassy and still. Then the moon rises: 94% full, enormous, painting silver ripples across the water. As we clean up, fog begins rolling in like a slow-motion wave. In this moment, every ounce of packs-on hiking effort feels worth it.\nSunday morning = aeropresses at Lunch Lake, the Eastern Cascades stretching resplendent before us.\nThe wind is powerful Sunday morning, so we break camp quickly to begin our descent. The miles go significantly faster with gravity on our side now. Along the way we encounter some even-more-exotic mushrooms:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re idly chatting when a black bear materializes just off the trail to our left:\nTwenty feet away, maybe less. We freeze mid-sentence. The bear keeps foraging, completely unfazed—a neighbor tending its wild garden. Olympic\u0026rsquo;s black bears are small and intent on their berries, paying us no mind. Still, my heart pounds.\nSome hikers carry bear bells—their jingling echoes through the forest. I should get some. I bought bear spray before this trip but left it behind; Olympic has \u0026ldquo;not recorded a single bear attack in the history of the park\u0026rdquo; per their FAQs. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably return it.\nLooking Back \u0026amp; Forward Here\u0026rsquo;s last weekend\u0026rsquo;s trip report if you missed it.\nA Note on Stewardship\nThis trip happened during a federal government shutdown, which meant Olympic National Park was unstaffed. No rangers at the entrance station, no visitor center operations, no interpretive programs. Yet the park remained open, accessible, and breathtakingly beautiful.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a reminder that these places exist beyond politics—beyond the dysfunction that too often defines our government. The Seven Lakes Basin doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about budget negotiations or partisan gridlock. The bears keep harvesting berries, the fog keeps rolling in over Lunch Lake, and the trails remain open to anyone willing to put in the miles.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: these places need our protection. They need funding for trail maintenance, wildlife research, and visitor education. They need advocates who understand that public lands aren\u0026rsquo;t just recreation—they\u0026rsquo;re our shared inheritance, our connection to something larger than ourselves.\nEvery time we visit a national park, we\u0026rsquo;re voting with our feet. We\u0026rsquo;re saying these places matter. We\u0026rsquo;re investing in the idea that some things should remain wild, untamed, and accessible to everyone. Even when the government isn\u0026rsquo;t functioning, the land endures. And so must our commitment to protecting it.\nSo get out there. Apply for those permits, pack your bear canister, and go see what\u0026rsquo;s waiting for you in the backcountry. Leave no trace.\n","date":"1 October 2025","permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2025/olympics-backpacking/","section":"Blog","summary":"Bears, lakes, and an epic October backpacking trip in the Seven Lakes Basin","title":"Olympic National Park Backpacking Trip Report"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/tags/olympic-national-park/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Olympic-National-Park"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/tags/outdoor-adventure/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Outdoor-Adventure"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/","section":"Robert Boscacci","summary":"","title":"Robert Boscacci"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/tags/washington/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Washington"},{"content":"🤖 🧠 💻 A multi-modal AI bot for Bluesky social media 👨‍💻 🚴‍♂️ 🏙️\nThe Project Monday-Tuesday, I build and deploy a computer vision (\u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo;) powered Bluesky bot, along with a web control panel. Today I shut it down, because I\u0026rsquo;m told its replies are indistinguishable from a human user—which is annoying people. To be clear: I never type any replies myself.

Our first night is at Lake George Camp, the second at South Puyallup River Camp, and then we hike out on Sunday. If you’re interested in planning a similar trip, here’s how we approach it.\nPermits \u0026amp; Passes We reserve our wilderness permit in advance through recreation.gov (wilderness.gov redirects there). If you expect to pick up your permit after 12pm, be sure to let the rangers know you need a “late pickup”—otherwise, they may not hold your permit past noon.\nYou also need a park entrance pass. We use the very reasonably priced America the Beautiful Pass, which covers entry to all national parks for a year.\nAfter a certain point in the season, they remove the \u0026ldquo;bear poles\u0026rdquo; that people can use to safely store food (up high) at campsites. Since they\u0026rsquo;re coming down today, we bring our own bear-safe food canister for smellables.

If you can find a small group of people and make them amazingly happy, you will make money The genius of niches is they are too small for large competitors It’s cheaper to advertise to 5,000 people [Than 50k], and the odds are higher that they all hang out in the same place, be it a website, forum, blog, or magazine. The competition is also a lot lower What matters is finding a group of people who need your something more than they need the money you’re charging for it Provide your product with no hassles at a price where you make a healthy profit and you’re set If you choose a niche market and focus so tightly that your product becomes the best in class, members of that niche will have no choice but to use your product Here’s an exercise: Pick one person you know well\u0026hellip;your spouse, your brother, your sister, a parent, etc How hard would it be to design a product that you’re sure this person would use… not very hard, right? That’s because you know so much about the intimate details of their life Based on your knowledge of their interest in playing death metal on the banjo, for example, you might build a website that aggregates every death metal banjo tablature on the web Since your product would be so laser focused to their interests, it wouldn’t already exist The larger a market, the more money you’ll need to spend in order to locate people willing to buy your product Instead of marketing to everyone who likes to travel, how about tailoring your product to people who like to travel to the American Northwest? If a publisher started a magazine aimed at a niche, and full-page ads are less than $5,000, it’s a good niche to explore If you provide something so uniquely targeted towards them you can focus the ad itself, your copy, and your product on what they need, they are more likely to visit your website Owning the majority of a $500,000/year market is enough to support a very profitable startup Less competition means you are able to charge more for your product, resulting in higher margins Niche Markets Are Not Used to Good Marketing If you take out an ad on websites they visit, advertise on AdWords for similar keywords, and have a Facebook group, in a small niche it’s likely they’ll run into you more than once over a short period of time Given the number of marketing messages we hear every day, hearing about anything more than once has become remarkable Building an invoicing solution that satisfies every single pain point for pool cleaners is not that difficult. They have well-defined needs that are common to pretty much anyone who services pools for a living Niche Ideas Finding a niche and deciding on a product is all about marketing, and marketing is a fuzzy, imprecise discipline Without a niche “insider” your chances of success are dubious at best The best place to start is with your contact for the niche Everyone loves to talk about their daily woes, and especially about how awful their software is Make two columns on a piece of paper In the header of the left column write “Person” and in the right one write “Hobby or Work Experience.” Now for each row write the name of someone you know, including yourself, friends, relatives or colleagues, and write their work experience or hobby in the right column. These are your warm niches Determine what kind of software each of these niches desperately needs Approach #1: Look at All Areas of Your Life Examine your hobbies, interests and work experience Approach #2: Look at Occupations Scan through the following lists of occupations to determine if you have any experience with them, or if you know someone who does: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_occupations http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.t01.htm Evaluating Niches Consider the cost of marketing to a specific niche You want a market that is already looking for your product, even if [your product] doesn’t exist. Creating demand is very, very expensive while filling existing demand is, by comparison, cheap Any target market you choose must be online and you must have a product that solves their problem You’re going to want to narrow your focus to consumers, small businesses, or in certain cases, both These demographics have purchasing authority, make fast purchasing decisions, and search for solutions online There are two questions you need to answer about a potential niche: Is the market large enough? Is there an inexpensive way to reach them? Right Size Niche If a market has a magazine devoted to it, it’s large enough to provide enough customers Look at census and labor statistics to get an estimate of your market size. “Market size” research should involve the following: A web search for related magazines and websites Tracking down their advertising rate cards Reviewing their circulation (for magazines), visitor statistics (for websites), and rates Entering websites without rate cards into Compete.com to check traffic levels Checking in with your friendly neighborhood bureau of labor statistics for a sanity check on your findings If you’re taking a trip to your local library you can check out\u0026hellip;The Standard Periodicals Directory Visit the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and search for Occupational Employment Statistics A couple clicks later and you find there are 23,240 Marriage and family therapists in the U.S (as of April, 2009) Be wary of a market if you are unable to find a handful of websites or a magazine/journal dedicated to it, and the labor statistics claim less than 10,000 members The second question you need to ask about a potential market is: how will you reach them in an inexpensive, sustainable manner? When looking at your marketing plan you should actually be thinking: “If I could get only on the front page of [small-but-very-focused-niche-website].com.” Find the website(s) where your real market hangs out. These are the people who will actually buy your product Inexpensive Marketing A large market is not helpful if you can’t reach them economically through a specific website or magazine If a niche does not have a magazine devoted to it, it’s not necessarily too small If a full-page magazine ad is less than $5,000, the market is small enough that you’ll be able to effectively market to it You must have an inexpensive, ongoing source of new customers The Top Shelf approaches focus on two key areas: Building an audience Search engine optimization Second Shelf approaches\u0026hellip;.include: Building internet buzz and referral traffic Joint venture partnerships Article marketing Cold calling And so on… Industries like pool cleaners or countertop installers have business [leaders] who are pushing the industry forward, finding and adopting new techniques, and communicating those techniques to the rest of the industry through conferences, trade shows, trade publications, online forums, social networks or mailing lists Having a handful of places where they congregate makes marketing much easier since you can simply attend (or sponsor) trade meetings or conferences If you decide to use direct mail, cold calling or direct email marketing, there are lists available for specific industries. These lists will likely convert well if your product is targeted at the niche Conversion Rates Conversion rate will refer to the percentage of website visitors who buy your product Conversion rates vary based on a number of factors including the source of the traffic, your sales website’s effectiveness, and whether your product is properly priced If your price point is in what I refer to as the consumer range of $1 to $50 and your product is priced appropriately for your market: Your conversion rate should be between 1% and 4% If you’re priced between $50 and $1,000 or offer recurring pricing and your product is priced appropriately for your market: You’ll most likely convert between 0.5% and 2% Excluding advertising, which can vary depending on your campaign, a very general rule: 1/3rd of traffic from search engines 1/3rd from incoming links 1/3rd from direct traffic It will take a few months to begin ranking for enough terms to bring in a noticeable stream of traffic Gauge demand for a product before you build it based on monthly Google searches for certain terms Keyword difficulty tools can give us an estimate of the difficulty to rank for a term Step 1: Google AdWords Keyword Tool At the time of this writing, the AdWords Keyword Tool over-estimates search traffic The rule of thumb is to take the value it shows and cut it in half Multiply that 50% value by 4 to get an approximate overall traffic if you ranked #1 for this keyword Step 2: Choose Keywords Once you’ve chosen an anchor keyword like “attorney billing software” look at the tool results for other related keywords and track them in a text file Keywords like “legal billing software” and “attorney invoicing software” qualify as related terms Step 3: Keyword Difficulty Tool Get a rough approximation (based on the number of search results returned in Google) of how hard it is to rank for this term. The lower the score, the better Step 4: Sanity Check Google for your keyword. Navigate to the first result in the list Look at the PageRank of this page using the Google Toolbar (if you don’t have it, get it) View the source of the page and look at the meta keywords and description Enter the domain into Network Solutions Whois. Older domains have more credibility in Google Step 5: Finally, using the Google Toolbar, Click on the PageRank meter and from the drop down list select “Backward Links.” Stand up a Mini Sales Site to Test Conversion Make it 2-3 pages, where each page has one very specific goal If your product is a SaaS or mobile application, try to get visitors to click a “buy now” button on your Pricing \u0026amp; Sign-up page When someone clicks “Try it” or “Buy Now,” track conversions using Google AdWords and notify the prospect that your product is still in development Ask for their email address so you can notify them when you launch You’ll be able to see how much money you spent for each conversion After sending 100-200 visitors to your site, look at the numbers of “trials” or“purchases.” Assume you will convert between 2% and 5% of people who clicked “try now” or“download free trial.” Assume 40% of the people who clicked “buy now” would have completed the purchase ","date":"18 January 2024","permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2024/2024-01/2024-01-20_entrepreneurship/2024-01-20_walling/walling_niches/","section":"Blog","summary":"If you can find a small group of people and make them amazingly happy, you will make money","title":"Walling on Startup Niches"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s your most precious resource, as a founder? One of the biggest adjustments is accepting that time is your most precious commodity If you’re able to harness the power of leveraging software instead of time, you can achieve more freedom than you’re ready for It’s hard to re-train your mind out of the dollars-for-hours mentality. For me it took well over a year Before I start any task I ask myself: “Could one of my contractors possibly do this?” Putting a value on your time is a foundational step in becoming an entrepreneur, and it’s one many entrepreneurs never take Outsourcing aspects of your business is the single most powerful approach I’ve seen to increasing your true hourly rate as an entrepreneur Do Outsourcing If you value your time at $100/hour it makes certain decisions, such as outsourcing work to a $6/hour virtual assistant, a no-brainer Start small, gain comfort with a contractor, and gradually increase the amount you outsource Start with non-critical tasks and be very specific in how they should be executed Take a risk this month: outsource your first task and see where it takes you Valuation of Your Time Divide your current salary + benefits by 2,000 (the approximate number of hours worked in a year), rounded up to the nearest $5 increment If you are making $25/hour as an entrepreneur you are doing something wrong. Improve your marketing, grow your sales, find a new niche, outsource and automate While you won’t be earning anywhere near $50/hour when you begin building your product, once you launch you should aim to hit that number within 6 months Once you’ve established you’re worth $50/hour, paying someone $ 6/hour to handle administrative tasks or $15/hour to write code seems like a trip to the dollar store Using Time Well If your time is worth, say $75/hour, standing in line at the bank is painful. Sitting in traffic is another money waster – every non-productive, non-leisure minute you spend is another $1.25 down the drain Since it’s not practical to assume you will never wait in line again, the best counter-attack is to have a notebook and pen handy at all times. Use this time for high-level thinking, something you may have a hard time doing in front of a computer You will make bad decisions, waste time, waste money, run ineffective ads, miss deadlines, and release buggy code. Each time this happens, you have to accept that you failed and move on The faster you fail and learn from your mistakes, the faster you will improve. Pretty soon your ads won’t lose money, you’ll get better at estimating level of effort, and you’ll be sure to thoroughly test the complex parts of your code Outsourcing to a virtual assistant will dramatically reduce the time you need to spend on administrative tasks, and increase the time you can commit to growing your business Consider Human-Based \u0026ldquo;Automation\u0026rdquo; to prove value Every hour spent writing code is wasted time if that code could be replaced by a human being doing the same task until your product proves itself Being able to manually process some parts of a task can often reduce your development time by 50-80% \u0026hellip;.which allows you to get the feature out the door If customers decide to use it, then you can automate it Outsourcing provides you with a written process for the task\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;.that serves as a blueprint if the time comes later to automate it Customers make it necessary to put processes in place for: marketing, sales, support, and back-end administrative tasks Any ongoing work that can be described in a written process can be outsourced While most entrepreneurs feel like they need to keep the reins on level 1 email support, level 1 sales questions, manning the live chat window on your website, directory submissions, minor HTML tweaks, keyword research, link building, following up on canceled subscriptions, and running month-end reports… getting these tasks into the hands of a competent contractor frees up vast amounts of time that can be spent growing your business\nYou can only tell so much from a resume; the best way to evaluate is to try them out, and this means if they don’t work out you should make the decision quickly to find someone new.\n","date":"17 January 2024","permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/blog/2024/2024-01/2024-01-20_entrepreneurship/2024-01-20_walling/valuing_time/","section":"Blog","summary":"Putting a value on your time is a foundational step in becoming an entrepreneur","title":"Walling on Valuing Your Time"},{"content":"Ok, so marketing is crucial.

Text is a terrible selling tool Audio, video and images are always better Core Pages The Core Pages:\nHome Tour Testimonials Contact Us Pricing \u0026amp; Purchase The #1 goal of your home page is to convince your visitors to click 1 link\nThe key metric with home pages is abandonment rate\n(The number of people who leave without clicking a link) The solution:\nA simple home page with very few options, and large, clickable buttons If you choose to have an image for your home page,\n\u0026hellip;.choose one that shows the result of your product A home loan website should show people living in a house A backpacking website should show people on top of a mountain Your Hook Your hook is your four-second sales pitch and it should be the headline of your home page\n5-7 word summaries of your product When it launched, the iPod’s hook was “One Thousand Songs in Your Pocket” Each one conveys an image in your mind Each one describes what the product does and (in most cases) who it’s made for Hook ideas:\nExplain what your product does and for whom Such as “Simple proposal software made for designers.” Make a promise to the customer espousing a benefit of your product Such as “Save Time. Get Paid Faster.” Describe the single most remarkable feature of your product Spend a few minutes brainstorming your hook\nDiscuss it with a friend or colleague in your target market\nOnce you’ve decided on a hook, put it as the header on your home page\nConsider using it as your tagline\nAllows you to tell someone in 3 seconds what your product does What Else to Include Include medium-sized screen shots of the major screens filled with data Include a one-minute screencast (video demo) of each page Do not launch without testimonials You will have beta testers, friends and colleagues who try your software Get a handful of testimonials and create this page Monitor mentions of your product using Google Alerts Add choice quotes and backlinks to this page Include any relevant logos to break up the page Shows people that you will link to them if they write about your product Provide both a contact form in the browser and a separate email address Always provide a toll-free number, even if you let it go to voice mail and return the calls There is a great service called \u0026ldquo;Earth Class Mail\u0026rdquo; Allows you to pay around $20/ month for a P.O.

Imagine where these technologies might lead us, as a society.\nEarly Hype Advance readers wrote positive things about the pre-release manuscript. This makes me feel like the last ~22 months of research, writing, and editing have been worthwhile.\n“A comprehensive and well-researched exploration of the latest advancements in AI and systems design. Robert does an excellent job of balancing theoretical foundations with practical applications, making it an invaluable resource for students and professionals alike.” - Dr. Artem Trotsyuk, AI Ethics Fellow with the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics “A very practical and easy-to-read introduction on how AI computer vision manifests in many facets of our lives today. From AI computer vision\u0026#39;s theoretical origins to today\u0026#39;s self-driving cars, the book gives a thorough overview of where we are, and where could be headed with the technology through technical, political, and moral discourses.” - Bruce Li, Director and Screenwriter We hit the ground running on the amazon kindle store, hitting #1 bestseller in \u0026ldquo;Privacy \u0026amp; Surveillance,\u0026rdquo; momentarily surpassing Cathy O\u0026rsquo;Neil\u0026rsquo;s essential Weapons of Math Destruction:\nIt was also #1 in hot new \u0026ldquo;Computer Vision \u0026amp; Pattern Recognition\u0026rdquo; books:\nI\u0026rsquo;m chuffed!\nLong Synopsis The Spring of Sight is a journalistic tour of today’s renaissance in Computer Vision, the branch of AI where engineers and researchers are teaching computers to “see” and interface with the world based on visual information.\nMy writing journey began when I realized that the average person in my immediate circle was unaware of the quiet revolution happening in computer vision, a field that many don\u0026rsquo;t know exists. The explosive acceleration of this field will have a lasting impact on the world around you, from how you’re treated at the hospital to how you get to the grocery store.\nMy hope is that in reading The Spring of Sight, you will discover just how pervasive this suite of technologies is going to become in your world on several scales, and what you can do to prepare. Over the course of the book’s twelve chapters, I hope to instill in you the same sort of cautious optimism that I harbor with respect to computer vision.\nUltimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you add your voice to the conversation, so that you can navigate and ultimately help sculpt what might otherwise become a dystopian future.\nAs you read, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn about computer vision\u0026rsquo;s potential to:\nEase the burden on overworked healthcare workers Curb gambling addiction Be incredibly harmful (like, terribly racist) Supercharge Hollywood and sports broadcasting Transform the consumer experience Also featured:\nHow China and Russia have deployed computer vision in Orwellian ways (that we should avoid) Exclusive interviews with bleeding-edge researchers and engineers (at e.g. MIT, FLIR, and Adobe) You will love The Spring of Sight if you’re excited about technology’s promise to improve our lives and society—or if you’re a skeptic who feels that tech “solutions” only dig us into deeper trouble. Readers of Popular Science/Mechanics, the technology section of the news, John Carreyrou’s Bad Blood, or Cathy O’Neil’s Weapons of Math Destruction should get a kick out of this.\nThe Spring of Sight is a nonfiction book that speaks to futurists and activists who are looking at image-based automation and mass surveillance for the first time.\nAbout the Author Robert Boscacci was the Data Science Lead at Butter Works, a startup that used computer vision to analyze thousands of social media videos for clients like Netflix, Spotify, and ViacomCBS. He comes from a background in New York City\u0026rsquo;s film post-production industry, with IMdB credits as a film colorist and dailies technician on Netflix original features and episodic productions.\nBoscacci is curious about how tech policy can become more proactive, so that communities and organizations maximize the utility and minimize the harm of cutting edge tools. He hopes to encourage readers from all walks of life to join the conversation around tech and policy so that the folks who normally get steamrolled in the name of progress are more empowered to make their voices heard.\nBoscacci is a bright-eyed new Seattleite: Picture him wearing his nearly non-prescription glasses, dismounting his 2001 road bike while tapping to pay for a single-origin espresso on his way to the repertory cinema. He just got his boater safety card and is looking for pals with whom to cycle and play pickleball, plus seeking his next home chess meetup.\nHe can be emailed at rob[at]boscacci[dot]com.\n","date":"15 August 2022","permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/book/","section":"Robert Boscacci","summary":"How does the human experience change, now that computers can \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo;?","title":"The Spring of Sight"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://robertboscacci.com/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
